There is a marking guide at the end of the lab manual.  If figures are required, label the axes and provide a legend when appropriate.  An abstract, introduction, and conclusion are required as well, for which cells are provided at the end of the notebook.  The abstract should be a brief description of the topic, the introduction a description of the goals of the lab, and the conclusion a summary of what you learned, what you found difficult, and your own ideas and observations.\n",

    "<h2>4. Introduction</h2>\n",
    "A genetic algorithm is an approach to machine learning that mimics evolution.  Unlike classical search and optimization methods, a GA begins its search with an initial set of randomly generated candidate solutions to the problem, referred to as *individuals* in a *population*.  Typically, an individual is represented by binary strings, but other encodings can be used (e.g. integers or real numbers).  The method of representation scheme has a major impact on the performance of the GA, as different schemes may cause different performance in terms of accuracy and computation time.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Once a random population is initialized, each individual is evaluated and assigned a fitness value, according to a fitness function defined by the user.  This marks the completion of a generation worth of individuals, leading to *crossover* between and *mutation* of individuals in the current generation.  These operations are performed only on selected members of the population, *parents*, typically based on fitness.  Crossover is analogous to reproduction, and involves the mixing of two parents' genetic information.  Mutation consists of changing an individual's representation (e.g. flipping 0 to 1).  Both operations are used to introduce new genetic information into the population such that other solutions are explored, and the algorithm does not settle with a local minimum/maximum.  This procedure is repeated until the maximum number of generations is reached, or a stopping criteria is met, and the best fit individual is chosen as the solution."

    "A team of climatologists is trying to optimize the energy usage of their wireless sensor network (WSN) of weather monitoring stations.  Their current setup involves all stations sending their data directly to the base station (BS).  However, they would like to explore the option of assigning cluster heads (CH) to some of these stations.  These CH's would collect the data from nearby regular stations (RS) and send it to the BS such that not every station has to communicate with the BS, thereby optimizing the total communication distance of the network.  In order to determine the optimal setup of both number and location of CH's, they are designing a genetic algorithm with the following parameters:\n",

Parents are selected using tournament selection, in which individuals are randomly chosen to be compared to another individual, and the most fit individual \"wins\".  For crossover, a single-point method is used, where a point is chosen in a parent's string, and the genetic information is swapped with another parent starting at that point.  Finally, the mutation function flips on average two bits of a chosen parent anywhere in its string.\n",
